- Do not publish unverified or defamatory claims. Every allegation must have verifiable source links and legal review. The project contains a "status" field for each allegation (unverified, verified, disputed), and an "evidenceUrls" field for source links.
- If you plan to store sensitive or legally extreme claims, consult legal counsel and implement moderation workflows.






- Add unit tests and CI workflows for code quality.- Add a logging and revision history for all claims to support accountability.- Implement backend (API & DB) if you need persistent user edits.- Add authentication and admin moderation for claims.Development roadmap (suggested)- Keep content factual and citable. Avoid publishing unverified accusations or personally-identifying allegations without evidence and legal review.
